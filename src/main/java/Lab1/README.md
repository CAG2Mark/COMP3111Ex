# COMP3111LEx
I am going to use this README as an opportunity to point out all the problems with this lab and why it is poorly designed.
1. Don't push `.idea` or other project settings... different people use different IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VSCode, or even neovim with some plugins... they may also have different preferences and system-specific things that will break if you share project settings.
2. Don't push `target` because it just pollutes the repository with stuff that is non-essential to running the code. Use CI if you really want to share binaries.
3. Naming conventions please... classes should be PascalCased, and parameters should be snakeCased.

Anyway, enjoy this image of IntelliJ.
